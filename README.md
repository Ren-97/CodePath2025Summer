# CodePath 2025 Summer

This repository contains my solutions for the **CodePath 2025 Summer** programming course.

## ðŸ“š Course Structure

The course is organized as follows:
- **Multiple Units**: Each unit covers different topics and concepts
- **2 Sections per Unit**: Each unit is divided into 2 sections  
- **4 Problem Sets per Section**:
  - 2 Standard problem sets
  - 2 Advanced problem sets

## ðŸŽ¯ Repository Contents

I have **randomly selected 2 problem sets from each unit** to work on and include in this repository. This represents a sampling of the course material rather than complete solutions for every assignment.

### Selection Methodology
- Randomly chose 2 out of 8 available problem sets per unit
- Mix of both standard and advanced difficulty levels
- Focused on diverse problem types and algorithmic concepts
